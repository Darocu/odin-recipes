                    <li>Add a layer of rice into the mold, pressing it down gently to create a solid base.</li>
                    <li>Lay a slice of cooked Spam on top of the rice.</li>
                    <li>Add another layer of rice on top of the Spam and press it down gently.</li>
                    <li>Fold the nori strip over the top of the rice and press it to seal the Musubi.</li>
