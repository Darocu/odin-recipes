                    <li>Cook the rice according to the package instructions. Typically, you'll use 2 cups of water for every cup of rice. Allow the rice to cool to room temperature.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Cut the nori sheets into strips about 1 inch wide. You'll use these to wrap the Spam Musubi.</li>

                    <li>Lay a strip of plastic wrap or a piece of plastic food wrap inside the mold for easy removal.</li>

                    <li>Add a layer of rice into the mold, pressing it down gently to create a solid base.</li>
                    <li>Lay a slice of cooked Spam on top of the rice.</li>

                    <li>Fold the nori strip over the top of the rice and press it to seal the Musubi.</li>
