This repository houses the website for The Odin Project Recipes page.

The objective here is to create a main index.html page with links to a few recipes.

Each recipe contains a descriptive header with further information in a paragraph element.
The ingredients and directions were created with organized lists then a nested unorganized list for sub-steps.

Take-aways: Use git add and git commit more often.
